          The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines
          the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
          technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
          languages such as JavaScript.

          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
          describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
          included cues for its appearance.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr />
    In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and
    prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share
    documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
    hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and
    server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems
    engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but
    the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
    Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
    encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
